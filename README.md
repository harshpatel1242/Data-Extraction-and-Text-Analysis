# Data Extraction and Text Analysis
The goal of this personal project is to extract textual data articles from the provided URL in CSV file and use text analysis to compute variables(14 variables such as POS and NEG score, FOG Index, Syllable Per Word and other 12 variables )


P.S. ->all text files(1.txt,121.txt all) you are seeing are the text files created after you run the .ipynb file 
-> the other main files are Input and output file(where you can see the diff between input file and output file)
